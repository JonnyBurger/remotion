Remotion Lambda is a highly concurrent distributed video rendering system. That means that the video rendering work is split up across many Lambda functions. How many Lambda functions exactly can be defined by you, or you let Remotions defaults decide.

## Setting the concurrency

You can set the concurrency via the [`framesPerLambda`](/docs/lambda/rendermediaonlambda#framesperlambda) option (or [`--frames-per-lambda`](/docs/lambda/cli/render#--frames-per-lambda) via CLI).

The concurrency is defined as `frameCount / framesPerLambda`. That means that the higher you set `framesPerLambda`, the lower the concurrency gets.

:::note
Example: You render a video that has a `durationInFrames` of `300` with a `framePerLambda` setting of `15`. The concurrency is `300 / 15 = 20`.
:::

## Default values

By default, Remotion chooses a value between 20 and âˆž for `framesPerLambda`. The longer the video, the higher the concurrency. As a baseline, no matter how short the video, always at least 20 frames are rendered per Lambda.

The following chart shows how the `framesPerLambda` and the implied concurrency is chosen based on the frame count:

The code for determining the `framesPerLambda` parameter is:

```tsx twoslash
import { interpolate } from "remotion";

export const bestFramesPerLambdaParam = (frameCount: number) => {
  // Between 0 and 10 minutes (at 30fps), interpolate the concurrency from 75 to 150
  const concurrency = interpolate(frameCount, [0, 18000], [75, 150], {
    extrapolateRight: "clamp",
  });

  // At least have 20 as a `framesPerLambda` value
  const framesPerLambda = Math.max(frameCount / concurrency, 20);

  // Evenly distribute: For 21 frames over 2 lambda functions, distribute as 11 + 10 ==> framesPerLambda = 11
  const lambdasNeeded = Math.ceil(frameCount / framesPerLambda);

  return Math.ceil(frameCount / lambdasNeeded);
};
```

## Concurrency limits

Ensure that you only set parameter within these limits to ensure the renders don't throw any errors:

- Minimum `framesPerLambda`: 4
- Maximum concurrency: 200

The Remotion Lambda defaults will never go outside these bounds.
