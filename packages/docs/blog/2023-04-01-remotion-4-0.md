This Remotion release brings the render button to the editor, new Rust-based infrastructure, and tons of new capabilities!

## Render button

## Breaking changes

In order to modernize our stack and fix some of our mistakes, we're making the following breaking changes:

- Node.JS 16 is now the minimum Node version.
- We removed the "Rich timeline" feature due to performance problems and confusing behavior created by mounting the component multiple times.
- We're dropping support for Lambda `x86_64` architecture. Now all Lambdas are `arm64` only.
